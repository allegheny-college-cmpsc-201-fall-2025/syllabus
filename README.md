# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages (Fall 2025)

## Boilerplate: Description, Distributions, & Outcomes

### Course Description

The course description, per the academic bulletin, is as follows:

> A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming
language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and
implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance,
and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles
and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and
efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use
state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results
through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to
use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

### Distribution Requirements

This course fulfills two distribution requirements: **Quantitative Reasoning**
**(QR)** and **Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**. Again, per the academic bulletin:

> **Quantitative Reasoning** is the ability to understand, investigate,
communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information
towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

> Courses involving **Scientific Process and Knowledge** aim to convey an
understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply
scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific
information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage
productively in problem solving.

### Course Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course should expect to be able to:

1. Correctly identify and describe the steps in the design and implementation of
   a programming language.

2. Effectively use programming language constructs to design correct, efficient,
   and well-tested programs in multiple programming languages, including but not
    limited to Java.

3. Interpret and use an existing programming language grammar.

4. Design, implement, and evaluate a correct scanner and parser for a
   programming language.

5. Using knowledge of the general principles of programming languages, correctly
   implement a computer program in a heretofore unknown programming language.

### Office Hours

Given the relatively small population of our course, appointments will not be
necessary; i.e., **all office hours are walk-in only**. That means first come,
first serve.

| Day | Time          |
| :-- | ------------: |
| Wed | 4:30p - 5:30p |
| Fri | 6:30p - 8:30p |

### A Note on Contacting the Instructor

Unfortunately, I have obligations outside of Allegheny College (namely, a day
job with local aerospace manufacturer Acutec) that generally makes regular
communication during normal business hours difficult, if not sometimes
impossible. That having been said, I will make all efforts to reply to attempts
to communicate with me within a timely manner: generally within one 24-hour
period, excluding weekends and holidays (work-life balance is important for
*all* of us, after all).

Additionally, it's worth noting that between class sessions, lab, and my office
hours, there is ample opportunity for us to see each other in-person on a daily
basis should you so desire! (Again, excluding weekends; absence makes the heart
grow fonder, after all). I suspect this will make face-to-face conversation the
preferred method of communicating with one another.

If my suspicion proves incorrect and you'd really rather just write me outside
of the times we see each other, my preferred mode of asynchronous correspondence
is Discord.
